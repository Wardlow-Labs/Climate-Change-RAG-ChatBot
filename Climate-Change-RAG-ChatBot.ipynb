       " '41\\nTechnical SummaryTS\\nIn this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three \\nworking groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, \\nconsiders dynamic and cascading consequences, describes with more \\ngeographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such \\nrisks over a range of scenarios. The focus on solutions encompasses the \\ninterconnections among climate responses, sustainable development \\nand transformation—and the implications for governance across scales \\nwithin the public and private sectors. The assessment therefore includes \\nclimate-related decision-making and risk management, climate resilient \\ndevelopment pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, \\nand also limits to adaptation and loss and damage. Specific focal \\nareas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of \\nresponses, such as cities. {1.3.1, 1.4.4, 16, 17, 18}\\nSecond, emphases on social justice, equity and different forms of \\nexpertise have emerged. As climate change impacts and implemented \\nresponses increasingly occur, there is heightened awareness of the \\nways that climate responses interact with issues of justice and social progress. In this report, expanded attention is given to inequity in \\nclimate vulnerability and responses, the role of power and participation \\nin processes of implementation, unequal and differential impacts \\nand climate justice. The historic focus on scientific literature has also \\nbeen increasingly accompanied by attention to and incorporation of \\nIndigenous knowledge, local knowledge, and associated scholars. \\n{1.3.2, 1.4.1, 17.5.2}\\nThird, AR6 has a more extensive focus on the role of transformation in \\nmeeting societal goals. {1.5}\\nThe following overarching conclusions have been derived from the \\nwhole of the assessment of WGII:\\ni) The magnitude of observed impacts and projected climate risks \\nindicate the scale of decision-making, funding and investment \\nneeded over the next decade if climate resilient development is to \\nbe achieved.\\n4.

       " '43\\nTechnical SummaryTSii) Since AR5, climate risks are appearing faster and will get more \\nsevere sooner (high confidence). Impacts cascade through natural \\nand human systems, often compounding with the impacts from \\nother human activities. Feasible, integrated mitigation and \\nadaptation solutions can be tailored to specific locations and \\nmonitored for their effectiveness while avoiding conflict with \\nsustainable development objectives and managing risks and trade-\\noffs (high confidence).iii) Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that \\nopportunities for adaptation to many climate risks will likely \\nbecome constrained and have reduced effectiveness should \\n1.5°C global warming be exceeded and that, for many locations \\non Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited. \\nThe maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will \\nrequire the achievement of mitigation targets.\\nBox\\xa0TS.1 | Core Concepts of the Report\\nThis box provides an overview of key definitions and concepts relevant to the WGII AR6 assessment, with a focus on those updated or \\nnew since AR5.\\nRisk in this report is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of \\nvalues and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions \\nbetween climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of \\nclimate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential \\ntrade-offs or negative side-effects. Risk management is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or \\nmagnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}\\nVulnerability is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity \\nor predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility \\nto harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and \\nassessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included—and often started \\nwith—exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual \\ndeterminants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across \\ncontexts. Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time. In WGII \\nAR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, \\nboth critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, exposure is defined as the presence of people; \\nlivelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets \\nin places and settings that could be adversely affected. Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as \\nmore dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}\\nAdaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in \\norder to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate \\nand its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails \\na process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, \\nautonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation. Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: \\n(a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Government, non-government, and \\nprivate-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five \\ngeneral stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also \\ninvolves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation \\noptions can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so-\\ncalled green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees). The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related \\nresponses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-\\nscale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation. {1.2.1, 17.4}\\nResilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend \\nor disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining \\nthe capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum \\nof meanings.

This report assesses literature \\nincluding that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase \\n(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from \\nillustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)2 scenarios, respectively3. Climate \\nimpacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some \\nrecent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding \\nsocioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as \\nappropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are \\nmany emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range \\nof possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII \\nalso assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios \\nare analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs2. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including \\nimpacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 \\nSPM.C, WGI AR6 Box\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, WGI AR5}\\nA common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference \\nperiod 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term \\n(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100). {CCB CLIMATE}\\nCommon levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication \\nof assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence. Robust geographical \\npatterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of \\ntiming when the global warming level is reached. {16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1}\\nWGI assessed increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]4 °C in 2011–2020 above 1850–1900. The estimated increase \\nin global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C).5 Considering \\nall five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach or exceed \\n1.5°C in the near-term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario6. {WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6 \\nTable\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB2.3}\\n1 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n2 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of \\nradiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n3 IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.\\n4 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.\\n5 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements \\nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n6 Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report \\n(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded \\nunder the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary \\novershoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming.TS.B Observed Impacts\\nThis section reports on how worldwide climate change is increasingly \\naffecting marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem \\nservices, water and food security, settlements and infrastructure, \\nhealth and well-being, and economies and culture, especially through \\ncompound stresses and events.

With about 2°C \\nwarming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of \\nundernourished people by 2050, affecting tens (under low vulnerability \\nand low warming) to hundreds of millions of people (under high \\nvulnerability and high warming, i.e., SSP-3-RCP6.0), particularly among \\nlow-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-\\nSaharan Africa, South Asia and Central America (high confidence), for \\nexample, between 8\\xa0million under SSP1-6.0 to up to 80\\xa0million people \\nunder SSP3-6.0.

These changes were obtained by combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based \\non past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (Box\\xa0TS.2). Changes relative to 1850–1900 based on 20-year averaging periods are \\ncalculated by adding 0.85°C (the observed global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995–2014. Very likely ranges \\nare shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 (WGI AR6 Figure\\xa0SPM.8). Assessments were carried out at the global scale for (b), (c), (d) and (e).\\n(b) The Reasons for Concern (RFC) framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk for five broad categories. Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming \\nlow to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an \\nemphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk \\n(yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key \\nrisks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates \\nvery high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature \\nof the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future \\nprojected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and \\nhave high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme \\nweather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, \\nand coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, \\nexposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives \\naffected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused \\nby global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Assessment methods are described in SM16.6 and are identical to AR5, but are enhanced \\nby a structured approach to improve robustness and facilitate comparison between AR5 and AR6. Risks for (c) terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and (d) ocean ecosystems. \\nFor (c) and (d), diagrams shown for each risk assume low to no adaptation. The transition to a very high risk level has an emphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits.\\n(e) Climate-sensitive human health outcomes under three scenarios of adaptation effectiveness. The assessed projections were based on a range of scenarios, including SRES, \\nCMIP5, and ISIMIP , and, in some cases, demographic trends. The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole °C within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP \\nscenarios in panel (a).\\n(f) Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness \\nof the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); \\nlikelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation. The full set of 127 assessed global and regional key \\nrisks is given in SMTS.4 and SM16.7. Diagrams are provided for some risks. The development of synthetic diagrams for Small Islands, Asia and Central and South America were \\nlimited by the availability of adequately downscaled climate projections, with uncertainty in the direction of change, the diversity of climatologies and socio-economic contexts \\nacross countries within a region, and the resulting low number of impact and risk projections for different warming levels. Absence of risks diagrams does not imply absence \\nof risks within a region.

       " '71\\nTechnical SummaryTSTS.D Contribution of Adaptation to Solutions\\nThis section covers climate change adaptation and explains how our \\nknowledge of it has progressed since AR5. The section begins with \\nan explanation of overall progress on adaptation and the adaptation \\ngaps and then discusses limits to adaptation. Maladaptation and the \\nunderlying evidence base are explained together with the strategies \\navailable to strengthen the biosphere that can help ecosystems \\nfunction in a changing climate. Different adaptation options across \\nwater, food, nutrition and ecosystem-based adaptation and other \\nnature-based solutions are also discussed and, in particular, the ways \\nin which urban systems and infrastructure are coping with adaptation. \\nAdaptation to sea level rise is specifically discussed given its global \\nimpact on coastal areas, while health, well-being, migration and \\nconflict are also explained as these warrant additional important \\nconsiderations. Justice and equity have a significant impact as well on \\nhow effective adaptation can be and are discussed as key issues that \\nrelate to decision-making processes on adaptation and the range of \\nenablers that can support adaptation. Lastly, the focus shifts to system \\ntransitions and transformational adaptation that are needed to move \\nclimate change adaptation forward in a rapidly warming world.\\nAdaptation progress and gaps\\nTS.D.1 Increasing adaptation is being observed in natural \\nand human systems (very high confidence), yet the majority \\nof climate risk management and adaptation currently being \\nplanned and implemented are incremental (high confidence). \\nThere are gaps between current adaptation and the adaptation \\nneeded to avoid the increase of climate impacts that can be \\nobserved across sectors and regions, especially under medium \\nand high warming levels (high confidence). {4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, \\n4.6.4, 4.6.5, 4.6.6, 4.6.7, 4.6.8, 4.6.9, Box\\xa04.3, Box\\xa04.5, Box\\xa04.6, \\n7.4.1, Table\\xa04.8, Figure\\xa04.24, Figure\\xa06.4.3, Figure\\xa06.5, 9.3.1, 9.6.4, \\n9.8.3, 9.11.4, 13.2, 13.11, 14.7.1, 16.3, 16.4, 17.2.2, CCP5.2.4, \\nCCP5.2.7, CCP7.5.1, CCP7.5.2}\\nTS.D.1.1 Responses have accelerated in both developed and \\ndeveloping regions since AR5, with some examples of regression \\n(high confidence). Growing adaptation knowledge in public and \\nprivate sectors, increasing numbers of policy and legal frameworks \\nand dedicated spending on adaptation are all clear indications that \\nthe availability of response options has expanded (high confidence). \\nHowever, observed adaptation in human systems across all sectors \\nand regions is dominated by small incremental, reactive changes to \\nusual practices often after extreme weather events, while evidence \\nof transformative adaptation in human systems is limited (high \\nconfidence). Droughts, pluvial, fluvial and coastal flooding are the \\nmost common hazards for which adaptation is being implemented, \\nand many of these have physical, affordability and social limits (high \\nconfidence). There is some evidence of global vulnerability reduction, \\nparticularly for flood risk and extreme heat. {1.4.5, 2.4.2, 2.4.5, \\n2.5.4, 2.6.1, 2.6.6, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.6.3, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, 4.6.4, 4.6.5, \\n4.6.6, 4.6.7, 4.6.8, 4.6.9, Box\\xa04.3, Box\\xa04.5, Box\\xa04.6, 7.4.1, Table\\xa04.8, \\nFigure\\xa04.24, 11.6, Table\\xa011.14, Box\\xa011.2, 12.12.5, 13.2.2, 13.10, 13.11, \\n14.7.1, 15.5.4, 16.3.2, 16.4.2, 12.3, CCB EXTREMES}TS.D.1.2 Current adaptation in natural and managed ecosystems \\nincludes earlier planting and changes in crop varieties, soil \\nimprovement and water management for livestock and crops, \\naquaculture, restoration of coastal and hydrological processes, \\nintroduction of heat- and drought-adapted genotypes into high-\\nrisk populations, increasing the size and connectivity of habitat \\npatches, agroecological farming, agroforestry and managed \\nrelocations of high-risk species (medium confidence). These \\nmeasures can increase the resilience, productivity and sustainability of \\nboth natural and food systems under climate change (high confidence). \\nFinancial barriers limit the implementation of adaptation options in \\nnatural ecosystems, agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry as \\nfinancial strategies are stochastically deployed.

Climate change hazards and exposure levels are not included in this figure. The relative level of average national vulnerability is shown by the colours. Vulnerability values \\nare based on the average of the two indices, classified into 5 classes using the quantile method. A hexagon binning method was used to simplify the global map and enlarge small \\nstates. The map combines information about the level of vulnerability (independent of the population size) with two classes of population density (high density ≥ 20 people/km2 \\nand low density < 20 people/km2). The selected examples of local vulnerable populations underscore that there are also highly vulnerable populations in countries with overall low \\nrelative vulnerability {8.3.2, Figure\\xa08.6} (b) This figure shows regional averages for selected aspects of human vulnerability. The indicators are a selection of the indicator systems \\nused within the global vulnerability map (panel a). The colours represent the average value of the respective indicator for the regional level; classified into three classes using natural \\nbreaks. This regional information reveals that within all regions challenges exist in terms of different aspects of vulnerability, however, in some regions these challenges are more \\nsevere and accumulate in multiple-dimensions. For example, the indicator “dependency ratio” measures the ratio of the number of children (0–14\\xa0years old) and older persons \\n(65\\xa0years or over) to the working-age population (15–64\\xa0years old). {8.3.2, Figure\\xa08.7} (c) The pie charts show the number of deaths (mortality) per hazard (storm, flood, drought, \\nheatwaves and wildfires) event per continental region based on Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, 2020). The size of the \\npie chart represents the average mortality per hazard event while slices of each pie chart show the absolute number of deaths from each hazard. This reveals that significantly more \\nfatalities per hazard (storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires) did occur in the past decade in more vulnerable regions, e.g. Africa and Asia. {Figure\\xa08.6} (d) The figure \\nshows constraints that make it harder to plan and implement human adaptation. Across regions and sectors, the most significant challenges to human adaptation are financial, \\ngovernance, institutional and policy constraints. The ability of actors to overcome these socio-economic constraints largely influences whether additional adaptation is able to be \\nimplemented and prevent limits to adaptation from being reached. Low: <20% of assessed literature identifies this constraint; Medium: 20–40% of assessed literature identifies \\nthis constraint; High: >40% of assessed literature identifies this constraint. {9.3, 16.4.3, Figure\\xa016.8}',\n",

       " '84\\nTechnical Summary\\nTSTS.D.1.5 Systemic barriers constrain the implementation of \\nadaptation options in vulnerable sectors, regions and social \\ngroups (high confidence). Key barriers are limited resources, lack \\nof private-sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilisation of \\nfinance (including for research), lack of political leadership, limited \\nresearch and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation science and \\na low sense of urgency. Most of the adaptation options to the key \\nrisks depend on limited water and land resources (high confidence). \\nGovernance capacity, financial support and the legacy of past urban \\ninfrastructure investment constrain how cities and settlements \\nare able to adapt (high confidence). Critical urban capacity gaps \\ninclude limited ability to identify social vulnerability and community \\nstrengths, the absence of integrated planning to protect communities, \\nthe lack of access to innovative funding arrangements and a limited \\ncapability to manage finance and commercial insurance (medium \\nconfidence). Prioritisation of options and transitions from incremental \\nto transformational adaptation are limited due to vested interests, \\neconomic lock-ins, institutional path dependencies and prevalent \\npractices, cultures, norms and belief systems. For example, Africa faces \\nsevere climate data constraints and inequities in research funding and \\nleadership that reduce adaptive capacity (very high confidence)—from \\n1990 to 2019 research on Africa received just 3.8% of climate-related \\nresearch funding globally, and 78% of this funding for Africa went \\nto European Union- and North America–based institutions and only \\n14.5% to African institutions. {3.6.3, 9.1.5, 9.5.1, 9.8.4, 12.5.1, 12.5.5, \\n12.5.7, 12.8, 13.11, 14.7.2, 15.6.1, 15.7, CCP7.6, CCB FEASIB}\\nTS.D.1.6 Insufficient financing is a key driver of adaptation gaps \\n(high confidence). Annual finance flows targeting adaptation \\nfor Africa, for example, are billions of US dollars less than the \\nlowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change \\n(high confidence). Finance has not targeted more vulnerable countries \\nand communities. From 2014 to 2018 a greater amount of financial \\ncommitments to developing countries was in the form of debt rather \\nthan grants, and—excluding multilateral development banks—only \\n51% of commitments targeting adaptation were dispersed (compared \\nto 85% for other development projects). Tracked private-sector finance \\nfor climate change action has grown substantially since 2015, but \\nthe proportion directed towards adaptation has remained small (high \\nconfidence); in 2018 contributions were 0.05% of total climate finance \\nand 1% of adaptation finance. Globally, private-sector financing of \\nadaptation has been limited, especially in developing countries (high \\nconfidence). {3.6.3, 4.7,4, 4.7.5, 4.8.2, 6.4.5, Table\\xa06.10, 9.4.1, 12.5.4, \\n12.5.8, 15.6.3, 17.4.3, CCB FINANCE}\\nTS.D.1.7 Closing the adaptation gap requires moving beyond \\nshort-term planning to develop long-term, concerted pathways \\nand enabling conditions for ongoing adaptation to ensure \\ntimely and effective implementation (high confidence). Inclusive, \\nequitable and just adaptation pathways are critical for climate resilient \\ndevelopment. Such pathways require consideration of SDGs, gender \\nand Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and practices. The \\nsuccess of adaptation will depend on our understanding of which \\nadaptation options are feasible and effective in their local context \\n(high confidence). Long lead times for nature-based and infrastructure \\nsolutions or planned relocation will require implementation in the \\ncoming decade to reduce risks in time.

This figure builds on Figure\\xa0SPM.9 in AR5 WGII (depicting climate resilient pathways)\\xa0by describing how climate resilient development pathways are the result of \\ncumulative societal choices and actions within multiple arenas.\\nPanel (a) Societal choices towards higher climate resilient development (green cog) or lower climate resilient development (red cog) result from interacting decisions and actions \\nby diverse government, private sector and civil society actors, in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. These actors engage with adaptation, \\nmitigation and development actions in political, economic and financial, ecological, socio-cultural, knowledge and technology, and community arenas from local to international \\nlevels. Opportunities for climate resilient development are not equitably distributed around the world.\\nPanel (b) Cumulatively, societal choices, which are made continuously, shift global development pathways towards higher (green) or lower (red) climate resilient development. \\nPast conditions (past emissions, climate change and development) have already eliminated some development pathways towards higher climate resilient development (dashed \\ngreen line).\\nPanel (c) Higher climate resilient development is characterised by outcomes that advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development is progressively harder \\nto achieve with global warming levels beyond 1.5°C. Inadequate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 reduces climate resilient development \\nprospects. There is a narrowing window of opportunity to shift pathways towards more climate resilient development futures as reflected by the adaptation limits and increasing \\nclimate risks, considering the remaining carbon budgets.

Severity has been assessed looking at the magnitude of \\nadverse consequences, the likelihood of adverse consequences, the \\ntemporal characteristics of the risk and the ability to respond to the \\nrisks.

It provides technical \\nunderstanding and is developed from the key findings of chapters and \\ncross-chapter papers (CCPs) as presented in their executive summaries \\nand integrates across them. The report builds on the WGII contribution \\nto the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC and three special \\nreports of the AR6 cycle providing new knowledge and updates. The \\nthree special reports are the Special Report on Global Warming of \\n1.5°C (2018), an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming \\nof 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse \\ngas emission pathways in the context of strengthening the global \\nresponse to the threat of climate change, sustainable development \\nand efforts to eradicate poverty; the Special Report on Climate Change \\nand Land, which is concerned with climate change, desertification, \\nland degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and \\ngreenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (2019); and the Special \\nReport on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019). \\nThe WGII assessment integrates with the WGI (the physical science \\nbasis) and WGIII (mitigation of climate change) contributions and \\ncontributes to the Synthesis Report.\\nThe contribution of Working Group II (WGII) to the Sixth Assessment \\nReport (AR6) of the IPCC summarizes the current understanding of \\nobserved climate change impacts on ecosystems, human societies \\nand their cities, settlements, infrastructures and industrial systems, as \\nwell as vulnerabilities and future risks tied to different socioeconomic \\ndevelopment pathways. The report is set against a current backdrop \\nof rapid urbanisation, biodiversity loss, a growing and dynamic global \\nhuman population, significant inequality and demands for social justice, \\nrapid technological change, continuing poverty, land degradation \\nand food insecurity, and risks from shocks such as pandemics and \\nincreasingly intense extreme events from ongoing climate change. \\nThe report also assesses existing adaptations and their feasibility and \\nlimits. Any success of adaptation is dependent on the achieved level of \\nmitigation and the transformation of global and regional sustainability \\noutlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, \\nadaptation is essential for climate resilient development. Compared to \\nearlier IPCC assessments, this report integrates more strongly across \\nthe natural, social and economic sciences, highlighting the role of social \\njustice and diverse forms of knowledge, such as Indigenous knowledge \\nand local knowledge, and reflects the increasing importance of urgent \\nand immediate action to address climate risk. {1.1.1}\\nSince AR5, climate action has increased at all levels of governance, \\nincluding among non-governmental organisations, small and large \\nenterprises, and citizens. Two international agreements—the United \\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris \\nAgreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—\\njointly provide overarching goals for climate action. The 2030 Agenda \\nfor Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015 by UN member states, \\nsets out 17 SDGs, frames policies for achieving a more sustainable future and aligns efforts globally to prioritise ending extreme poverty, \\nprotect the planet and promote more peaceful, prosperous and \\ninclusive societies. Since AR5, several new international conventions \\nhave identified climate change adaptation and risk reduction as \\nimportant global priorities for sustainable development, including the \\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the finance-\\noriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the New Urban Agenda. The \\nConvention on Biological Diversity and its Aichi targets recognise that \\nbiodiversity is affected by climate change, with negative consequences \\nfor human well-being, but biodiversity, through ecosystem services, \\ncontributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation. {1.1.2}.A.2 TS Structure of the Report\\nThis technical summary is structured in five sections: Section A \\n‘Introduction’, Section B ‘Observed Impacts and Adaptation’, Section \\nC ‘Projected Impacts and Risks’, Section D ‘Contribution of Adaptation \\nto Solutions’ and Section E ‘Climate Resilient Development’. Each \\nsection includes several headline statements followed by several \\nbullet points providing details about the underlying assessments. All \\nfindings and figures are supported by and traceable to the underlying \\nreport, indicated by references {in curly brackets} to relevant sections \\nof chapters and cross-chapter papers.\\nConfidence in the key findings of this assessment is communicated \\nusing the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language. This calibrated \\nlanguage is designed to consistently evaluate and communicate \\nuncertainties that arise from incomplete knowledge due to a lack \\nof information or from disagreement about what is known or even \\nknowable. The IPCC calibrated language uses qualitative expressions \\nof confidence based on the robustness of evidence for a finding \\nand (where possible) uses quantitative expressions to describe the \\nlikelihood of a finding. Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of \\nunderlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed \\nusing five qualifiers, very low, low, medium, high and very high, and \\ntypeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms \\nhave been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or \\na result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, \\nlikely 66–100%, as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely \\n0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in \\nitalics, for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the \\nother AR6 reports. (Figure\\xa0TS.1) {1.3.4}.A.3 Key Developments Since AR5\\nInterdisciplinary climate change assessment, which has played a \\nprominent role in science–society interactions on the climate issue \\nsince 1988, has advanced in important ways since AR5. Building on \\na substantially expanded scientific and technical literature, this AR6 \\nreport emphasises at least three broad themes. (Figure\\xa0TS.2) {1.1.4}\\nFirst, this AR6 assessment has an increased focus on risk and solution \\nframeworks. The risk framing can move beyond the limits of single \\nbest estimates or most likely outcomes and include high-consequence \\noutcomes for which probabilities are low or in some cases unknown.',\n",
       " 'In this report, the risk framing for the first time spans all three \\nworking groups, includes risks from the responses to climate change, \\nconsiders dynamic and cascading consequences, describes with more \\ngeographic detail risks to people and ecosystems, and assesses such \\nrisks over a range of scenarios. The focus on solutions encompasses the \\ninterconnections among climate responses, sustainable development \\nand transformation—and the implications for governance across scales \\nwithin the public and private sectors. The assessment therefore includes \\nclimate-related decision-making and risk management, climate resilient \\ndevelopment pathways, implementation and evaluation of adaptation, \\nand also limits to adaptation and loss and damage. Specific focal \\nareas reflect contexts increasingly important for the implementation of \\nresponses, such as cities. {1.3.1, 1.4.4, 16, 17, 18}\\nSecond, emphases on social justice, equity and different forms of \\nexpertise have emerged. As climate change impacts and implemented \\nresponses increasingly occur, there is heightened awareness of the \\nways that climate responses interact with issues of justice and social progress. In this report, expanded attention is given to inequity in \\nclimate vulnerability and responses, the role of power and participation \\nin processes of implementation, unequal and differential impacts \\nand climate justice. The historic focus on scientific literature has also \\nbeen increasingly accompanied by attention to and incorporation of \\nIndigenous knowledge, local knowledge, and associated scholars. \\n{1.3.2, 1.4.1, 17.5.2}\\nThird, AR6 has a more extensive focus on the role of transformation in \\nmeeting societal goals. {1.5}\\nThe following overarching conclusions have been derived from the \\nwhole of the assessment of WGII:\\ni) The magnitude of observed impacts and projected climate risks \\nindicate the scale of decision-making, funding and investment \\nneeded over the next decade if climate resilient development is to \\nbe achieved.\\n4.

These interactions are the basis of emerging risks from \\nclimate change, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, at the same time, offer opportunities for the future.\\n(a) Human society causes climate change. Climate change, through hazards, exposure and vulnerability generates impacts and risks that can surpass limits to adaptation and result in losses and damages. Human society can adapt to, \\nmaladapt and mitigate climate change, ecosystems can adapt and mitigate within limits. Ecosystems and their biodiversity provision livelihoods and ecosystem services. Human society impacts ecosystems and can restore and conserve them.\\n(b) Meeting the objectives of climate resilient development thereby supporting human, ecosystem and planetary health, as well as human well-being, requires society and ecosystems to move over (transition) to a more resilient state. \\nThe recognition of climate risks can strengthen adaptation and mitigation actions and transitions that reduce risks. Taking action is enabled by governance, finance, knowledge and capacity building, technology and catalysing conditions. \\nTransformation entails system transitions strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and society (Section E). In a) arrow colours represent principle human society interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) and \\nthe impacts of climate change and human activities, including losses and damages, under continued climate change (red). In b) arrow colours represent human system interactions (blue), ecosystem (including biodiversity) interactions (green) \\nand reduced impacts from climate change and human activities (grey). {1.2, Figure\\xa01.2}',\n",
       " 'TSii) Since AR5, climate risks are appearing faster and will get more \\nsevere sooner (high confidence). Impacts cascade through natural \\nand human systems, often compounding with the impacts from \\nother human activities. Feasible, integrated mitigation and \\nadaptation solutions can be tailored to specific locations and \\nmonitored for their effectiveness while avoiding conflict with \\nsustainable development objectives and managing risks and trade-\\noffs (high confidence).iii) Available evidence on projected climate risks indicates that \\nopportunities for adaptation to many climate risks will likely \\nbecome constrained and have reduced effectiveness should \\n1.5°C global warming be exceeded and that, for many locations \\non Earth, capacity for adaptation is already significantly limited. \\nThe maintenance and recovery of natural and human systems will \\nrequire the achievement of mitigation targets.\\nBox\\xa0TS.1 | Core Concepts of the Report\\nThis box provides an overview of key definitions and concepts relevant to the WGII AR6 assessment, with a focus on those updated or \\nnew since AR5.\\nRisk in this report is defined as the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising the diversity of \\nvalues and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions \\nbetween climate-related hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system. In the context of \\nclimate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not to achieve the intended objective(s) or from potential \\ntrade-offs or negative side-effects. Risk management is defined as plans, actions, strategies or policies to reduce the likelihood and/or \\nmagnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}\\nVulnerability is a component of risk, but also, independently, an important focus. Vulnerability in this report is defined as the propensity \\nor predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility \\nto harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (Annex II: Glossary). Over the past several decades, approaches to analysing and \\nassessing vulnerability have evolved. An early emphasis on top-down, biophysical evaluation of vulnerability included—and often started \\nwith—exposure to climate hazards in assessing vulnerability. From this starting point, attention to bottom-up, social and contextual \\ndeterminants of vulnerability, which often differ, has emerged, although this approach is incompletely applied or integrated across \\ncontexts. Vulnerability is now widely understood to differ within communities and across societies, also changing through time. In WGII \\nAR6, assessment of the vulnerability of people and ecosystems encompasses the differing approaches that exist within the literature, \\nboth critiquing and harmonising them based on available evidence. In this context, exposure is defined as the presence of people; \\nlivelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, services and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural assets \\nin places and settings that could be adversely affected. Potentially affected places and settings can be defined geographically, as well as \\nmore dynamically, for example through transmission or interconnections through markets or flows of people. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}\\nAdaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects in \\norder to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate \\nand its effects; human intervention may facilitate this (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails \\na process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, \\nautonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation. Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: \\n(a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Government, non-government, and \\nprivate-sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, conform to these five \\ngeneral stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes autonomous adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also \\ninvolves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation \\noptions can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of so-\\ncalled green and grey infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees). The WGII AR6 emphasises the assessment of observed adaptation-related \\nresponses to climate change, governance and decision-making in adaptation and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-\\nscale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation. {1.2.1, 17.4}\\nResilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend \\nor disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining \\nthe capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum \\nof meanings. Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity and, thus, risk, and resilience as a \\nstrategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and transformation. Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience \\nas bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance. {1.2.1, Annex II: Glossary}',\n",
       " 'Box\\xa0TS.2 | AR6 Climate Dimensions, Global Warming Levels and Reference Periods\\nAssessments of climate risks consider possible future climate change, societal development and responses. This report assesses literature \\nincluding that based on climate model simulations that are part of the fifth and sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase \\n(CMIP5, CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. Future projections are driven by emissions and/or concentrations from \\nillustrative Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1 and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)2 scenarios, respectively3. Climate \\nimpacts literature is based primarily on climate projections assessed in AR5 or earlier, or assumed global warming levels, though some \\nrecent impacts literature uses newer projections based on the CMIP6 exercise. Given differences in the impacts literature regarding \\nsocioeconomic details and assumptions, WGII chapters contextualize impacts with respect to exposure, vulnerability and adaptation as \\nappropriate for their literature, this includes assessments regarding sustainable development and climate resilient development. There are \\nmany emissions and socioeconomic pathways that are consistent with a given global warming outcome. These represent a broad range \\nof possibilities as available in the literature assessed that affect future climate change exposure and vulnerability. Where available, WGII \\nalso assesses literature that is based on an integrative SSP-RCP framework where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios \\nare analysed against the backdrop of various illustrative SSPs2. The WGII assessment combines multiple lines of evidence including \\nimpacts modelling driven by climate projections, observations, and process understanding. {1.2, 16.5, 18.2, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 \\nSPM.C, WGI AR6 Box\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 1.6, WGI AR6 12, WGI AR5}\\nA common set of reference years and time periods are adopted for assessing climate change and its impacts and risks: the reference \\nperiod 1850–1900 approximates pre-industrial global surface temperature, and three future reference periods cover the near-term \\n(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100). {CCB CLIMATE}\\nCommon levels of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are used to contextualize and facilitate analysis, synthesis and communication \\nof assessed past, present and future climate change impacts and risks considering multiple lines of evidence. Robust geographical \\npatterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all scenarios considered and independent of \\ntiming when the global warming level is reached. {16.5, CCB CLIMATE, WGI AR6 Box\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 4.2, WGI AR6 CCB11.1}\\nWGI assessed increase in global surface temperature is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]4 °C in 2011–2020 above 1850–1900. The estimated increase \\nin global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22]°C).5 Considering \\nall five illustrative scenarios assessed by WGI, there is at least a greater than 50% likelihood that global warming will reach or exceed \\n1.5°C in the near-term, even for the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario6. {WGI AR6 SPM A1.2, WGI AR6 SPM B1.3, WGI AR6 \\nTable\\xa0SPM.1, WGI AR6 CCB2.3}\\n1 RCP-based scenarios are referred to as RCPy, where ‘y’ refers to the level of radiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n2 SSP-based scenarios are referred to as SSPx-y, where ‘SSPx’ refers to the Shared Socio-economic Pathway describing the socio-economic trends underlying the scenarios, and ‘y’ refers to the level of \\nradiative forcing (in watts per square meter, or W m-2) resulting from the scenario in the year 2100.\\n3 IPCC is neutral with regard to the assumptions underlying the SSPs, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Alternative scenarios may be considered or developed.\\n4 In the WGI report, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.\\n5 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements \\nhave also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5.\\n6 Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the intermediate, high and very high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios considered in this report \\n(SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021–2040), the 1.5°C global warming level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be exceeded under the intermediate and high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely than not to be exceeded \\nunder the low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be reached under the very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9). Furthermore, for the very low \\ngreenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary \\novershoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming.TS.B Observed Impacts\\nThis section reports on how worldwide climate change is increasingly \\naffecting marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem \\nservices, water and food security, settlements and infrastructure, \\nhealth and well-being, and economies and culture, especially through \\ncompound stresses and events. It refers to the increasing confidence \\nsince AR5 that detected impacts are attributable to climate change, \\nincluding the impacts of extreme events. It illustrates how compound hazards have become more frequent in all world regions, with \\nwidespread consequences. Regional increases in temperature, aridity \\nand drought have increased the frequency and intensity of fire.

Diagrams are shown for each RFC, assuming \\nlow to no adaptation (i.e., adaptation is fragmented, localized and comprises incremental adjustments to existing practices). However, the transition to a very high risk level has an \\nemphasis on irreversibility and adaptation limits. Undetectable risk level (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change; moderate risk \\n(yellow) indicates associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key \\nrisks; high risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts that are judged to be high on one or more criteria for assessing key risks; and very high risk level (purple) indicates \\nvery high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibility or the persistence of climate-related hazards, combined with limited ability to adapt due to the nature \\nof the hazard or impacts/risks. The horizontal line denotes the present global warming of 1.09°C which is used to separate the observed, past impacts below the line from the future \\nprojected risks above it. RFC1: Unique and threatened systems: ecological and human systems that have restricted geographic ranges constrained by climate-related conditions and \\nhave high endemism or other distinctive properties. Examples include coral reefs, the Arctic and its Indigenous Peoples, mountain glaciers and biodiversity hotspots. RFC2: Extreme \\nweather events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, \\nand coastal flooding. RFC3: Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups due to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards, \\nexposure or vulnerability. RFC4: Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages, lives \\naffected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5: Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems caused \\nby global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing.

The diagrams are truncated at the nearest whole °C within the range of temperature change in 2100 under three SSP \\nscenarios in panel (a).\\n(f) Examples of regional key risks. Risks identified are of at least medium confidence level. Key risks are identified based on the magnitude of adverse consequences (pervasiveness \\nof the consequences, degree of change, irreversibility of consequences, potential for impact thresholds or tipping points, potential for cascading effects beyond system boundaries); \\nlikelihood of adverse consequences; temporal characteristics of the risk; and ability to respond to the risk, e.g., by adaptation.

       " 'TSTS.D Contribution of Adaptation to Solutions\\nThis section covers climate change adaptation and explains how our \\nknowledge of it has progressed since AR5. The section begins with \\nan explanation of overall progress on adaptation and the adaptation \\ngaps and then discusses limits to adaptation. Maladaptation and the \\nunderlying evidence base are explained together with the strategies \\navailable to strengthen the biosphere that can help ecosystems \\nfunction in a changing climate. Different adaptation options across \\nwater, food, nutrition and ecosystem-based adaptation and other \\nnature-based solutions are also discussed and, in particular, the ways \\nin which urban systems and infrastructure are coping with adaptation. \\nAdaptation to sea level rise is specifically discussed given its global \\nimpact on coastal areas, while health, well-being, migration and \\nconflict are also explained as these warrant additional important \\nconsiderations. Justice and equity have a significant impact as well on \\nhow effective adaptation can be and are discussed as key issues that \\nrelate to decision-making processes on adaptation and the range of \\nenablers that can support adaptation. Lastly, the focus shifts to system \\ntransitions and transformational adaptation that are needed to move \\nclimate change adaptation forward in a rapidly warming world.\\nAdaptation progress and gaps.D.1 Increasing adaptation is being observed in natural \\nand human systems (very high confidence), yet the majority \\nof climate risk management and adaptation currently being \\nplanned and implemented are incremental (high confidence). \\nThere are gaps between current adaptation and the adaptation \\nneeded to avoid the increase of climate impacts that can be \\nobserved across sectors and regions, especially under medium \\nand high warming levels (high confidence). {4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, \\n4.6.4, 4.6.5, 4.6.6, 4.6.7, 4.6.8, 4.6.9, Box\\xa04.3, Box\\xa04.5, Box\\xa04.6, \\n7.4.1, Table\\xa04.8, Figure\\xa04.24, Figure\\xa06.4.3, Figure\\xa06.5, 9.3.1, 9.6.4, \\n9.8.3, 9.11.4, 13.2, 13.11, 14.7.1, 16.3, 16.4, 17.2.2, CCP5.2.4, \\nCCP5.2.7, CCP7.5.1, CCP7.5.2}.D.1.1 Responses have accelerated in both developed and \\ndeveloping regions since AR5, with some examples of regression \\n(high confidence). Growing adaptation knowledge in public and \\nprivate sectors, increasing numbers of policy and legal frameworks \\nand dedicated spending on adaptation are all clear indications that \\nthe availability of response options has expanded (high confidence). \\nHowever, observed adaptation in human systems across all sectors \\nand regions is dominated by small incremental, reactive changes to \\nusual practices often after extreme weather events, while evidence \\nof transformative adaptation in human systems is limited (high \\nconfidence).

Climate change hazards and exposure levels are not included in this figure. The relative level of average national vulnerability is shown by the colours. Vulnerability values \\nare based on the average of the two indices, classified into 5 classes using the quantile method. A hexagon binning method was used to simplify the global map and enlarge small \\nstates. The map combines information about the level of vulnerability (independent of the population size) with two classes of population density (high density ≥ 20 people/km2 \\nand low density < 20 people/km2). The selected examples of local vulnerable populations underscore that there are also highly vulnerable populations in countries with overall low \\nrelative vulnerability {8.3.2, Figure\\xa08.6} (b) This figure shows regional averages for selected aspects of human vulnerability. The indicators are a selection of the indicator systems \\nused within the global vulnerability map (panel a). The colours represent the average value of the respective indicator for the regional level; classified into three classes using natural \\nbreaks. This regional information reveals that within all regions challenges exist in terms of different aspects of vulnerability, however, in some regions these challenges are more \\nsevere and accumulate in multiple-dimensions. For example, the indicator “dependency ratio” measures the ratio of the number of children (0–14\\xa0years old) and older persons \\n(65\\xa0years or over) to the working-age population (15–64\\xa0years old). {8.3.2, Figure\\xa08.7} (c) The pie charts show the number of deaths (mortality) per hazard (storm, flood, drought, \\nheatwaves and wildfires) event per continental region based on Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) (Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, 2020). The size of the \\npie chart represents the average mortality per hazard event while slices of each pie chart show the absolute number of deaths from each hazard. This reveals that significantly more \\nfatalities per hazard (storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and wildfires) did occur in the past decade in more vulnerable regions, e.g. Africa and Asia. {Figure\\xa08.6} (d) The figure \\nshows constraints that make it harder to plan and implement human adaptation. Across regions and sectors, the most significant challenges to human adaptation are financial, \\ngovernance, institutional and policy constraints. The ability of actors to overcome these socio-economic constraints largely influences whether additional adaptation is able to be \\nimplemented and prevent limits to adaptation from being reached. Low: <20% of assessed literature identifies this constraint; Medium: 20–40% of assessed literature identifies \\nthis constraint; High: >40% of assessed literature identifies this constraint. {9.3, 16.4.3, Figure\\xa016.8}',\n",

       " 'TS.D.1.5 Systemic barriers constrain the implementation of \\nadaptation options in vulnerable sectors, regions and social \\ngroups (high confidence). Key barriers are limited resources, lack \\nof private-sector and citizen engagement, insufficient mobilisation of \\nfinance (including for research), lack of political leadership, limited \\nresearch and/or slow and low uptake of adaptation science and \\na low sense of urgency. Most of the adaptation options to the key \\nrisks depend on limited water and land resources (high confidence). \\nGovernance capacity, financial support and the legacy of past urban \\ninfrastructure investment constrain how cities and settlements \\nare able to adapt (high confidence). Critical urban capacity gaps \\ninclude limited ability to identify social vulnerability and community \\nstrengths, the absence of integrated planning to protect communities, \\nthe lack of access to innovative funding arrangements and a limited \\ncapability to manage finance and commercial insurance (medium \\nconfidence). Prioritisation of options and transitions from incremental \\nto transformational adaptation are limited due to vested interests, \\neconomic lock-ins, institutional path dependencies and prevalent \\npractices, cultures, norms and belief systems. For example, Africa faces \\nsevere climate data constraints and inequities in research funding and \\nleadership that reduce adaptive capacity (very high confidence)—from \\n1990 to 2019 research on Africa received just 3.8% of climate-related \\nresearch funding globally, and 78% of this funding for Africa went \\nto European Union- and North America–based institutions and only \\n14.5% to African institutions. {3.6.3, 9.1.5, 9.5.1, 9.8.4, 12.5.1, 12.5.5, \\n12.5.7, 12.8, 13.11, 14.7.2, 15.6.1, 15.7, CCP7.6, CCB FEASIB}.D.1.6 Insufficient financing is a key driver of adaptation gaps \\n(high confidence). Annual finance flows targeting adaptation \\nfor Africa, for example, are billions of US dollars less than the \\nlowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change \\n(high confidence). Finance has not targeted more vulnerable countries \\nand communities. From 2014 to 2018 a greater amount of financial \\ncommitments to developing countries was in the form of debt rather \\nthan grants, and—excluding multilateral development banks—only \\n51% of commitments targeting adaptation were dispersed (compared \\nto 85% for other development projects). Tracked private-sector finance \\nfor climate change action has grown substantially since 2015, but \\nthe proportion directed towards adaptation has remained small (high \\nconfidence); in 2018 contributions were 0.05% of total climate finance \\nand 1% of adaptation finance. Globally, private-sector financing of \\nadaptation has been limited, especially in developing countries (high \\nconfidence). {3.6.3, 4.7,4, 4.7.5, 4.8.2, 6.4.5, Table\\xa06.10, 9.4.1, 12.5.4, \\n12.5.8, 15.6.3, 17.4.3, CCB FINANCE}.D.1.7 Closing the adaptation gap requires moving beyond \\nshort-term planning to develop long-term, concerted pathways \\nand enabling conditions for ongoing adaptation to ensure \\ntimely and effective implementation (high confidence). Inclusive, \\nequitable and just adaptation pathways are critical for climate resilient \\ndevelopment. Such pathways require consideration of SDGs, gender \\nand Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and practices.

This figure builds on Figure\\xa0SPM.9 in AR5 WGII (depicting climate resilient pathways)\\xa0by describing how climate resilient development pathways are the result of \\ncumulative societal choices and actions within multiple arenas.\\nPanel (a) Societal choices towards higher climate resilient development (green cog) or lower climate resilient development (red cog) result from interacting decisions and actions \\nby diverse government, private sector and civil society actors, in the context of climate risks, adaptation limits and development gaps. These actors engage with adaptation, \\nmitigation and development actions in political, economic and financial, ecological, socio-cultural, knowledge and technology, and community arenas from local to international \\nlevels. Opportunities for climate resilient development are not equitably distributed around the world.\\nPanel (b) Cumulatively, societal choices, which are made continuously, shift global development pathways towards higher (green) or lower (red) climate resilient development. \\nPast conditions (past emissions, climate change and development) have already eliminated some development pathways towards higher climate resilient development (dashed \\ngreen line).\\nPanel (c) Higher climate resilient development is characterised by outcomes that advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development is progressively harder \\nto achieve with global warming levels beyond 1.5°C. Inadequate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 reduces climate resilient development \\nprospects. There is a narrowing window of opportunity to shift pathways towards more climate resilient development futures as reflected by the adaptation limits and increasing \\nclimate risks, considering the remaining carbon budgets.

This approach is described in Section TS.AII.3, along \\nwith a comparison with the RKRs (Section TS.AII.4). The burning embers \\nfor the global and cross-cutting RFCs are complemented by similar \\ndepictions for specific regional and thematic concerns (Section SMTS2.1)..AII.1 Key Risks and Representative Key Risks\\nRegional and sectoral chapters of this report identified 127 key \\nrisks that could become severe under particular conditions of \\nclimate hazards, exposure and vulnerability (Table\\xa0SMTS.4). These \\nkey risks are assessed to be potentially severe, that is, relevant to the \\ninterpretation of dangerous anthropogenic interference (DAI) with the \\nclimate system, along levels for warming, exposure/vulnerability and \\nadaptation. Severity has been assessed looking at the magnitude of \\nadverse consequences, the likelihood of adverse consequences, the \\ntemporal characteristics of the risk and the ability to respond to the \\nrisks. Key risks cover scales from the local to the global, are especially \\nprominent in particular regions or systems and are particularly large for \\nvulnerable sub-groups, especially low-income populations, and already \\nat-risk ecosystems (high confidence).\\xa0{16.5, Table\\xa0SM16.4}\\nThese key risks can be represented in eight RKR clusters of \\nkey risks relating to low-lying coastal systems; terrestrial and \\nocean ecosystems; critical physical infrastructure, networks and services; living standards; human health; food security; water \\nsecurity; and peace and mobility (high confidence) (Table\\xa0TS.\\nAII.1).\\xa0The assessment of these RKRs, which is presented in detail in \\nChapter 16, has also been used to organise the synthetic assessment \\nof adaptation options in Chapter 17 and is integrated across various \\nsections in the TS and SPM. {16.5, SM16.2.1, 17.2.1, 17.5.1}.AII.2 Assessment of Severity Conditions for \\nRepresentative Key Risks\\nFigure\\xa0TS.AII.1 presents a synthesis of the severity conditions for RKRs \\nby the end of this century. As an illustration of the more specific sets of \\nconditions that result in severe risk for a particular RKR, Figure\\xa0TS.AII.2 \\nprovides examples from individual studies of risks to living standards \\nand the conditions under which they could become severe in terms of \\naggregate economic output, poverty and livelihoods.\\nThe assessment of RKRs demonstrates that severe risk is rarely driven \\nby a single determinant (warming, exposure/vulnerability, adaptation), \\nbut rather by a combination of conditions that jointly produce the level \\nof pervasiveness of consequences, irreversibility, thresholds, cascading \\neffects, likelihood of consequences, temporal characteristics of risk \\nand systems’ ability to respond (medium\\xa0to\\xa0 high confidence).
